== Clause Sell or Buy ==

group Bid notice set up : bidder Alice, co-shareholder Bob, \ntotal share value n, overcharge x, duration d

holder_Alice -> blockchain : allow clause_sell_or_buy to freeze all her ERC1400 partitions
holder_Alice -> blockchain : allow clause_sell_or_buy to debit x ERC20 tokens
holder_Alice -> blockchain : allow ERC1400 to debit n ERC20 tokens

holder_Alice -> blockchain : launch notice for Bob
activate blockchain
blockchain -> blockchain : start notice timer \nfreeze Alice's partitions
deactivate blockchain
note left
the bid amount is e = n + x
valid during d
end note
end

group case 1 : Bob accepts in time and sells

holder_Bob -> blockchain : allow clause_sell_or_buy to freeze all his partitions
holder_Bob -> blockchain : accept Alice's bid e 
activate blockchain
blockchain -> blockchain : clause_sell_or_buy transfers \nall Bob's partitions to Alice 
deactivate blockchain
note left
clause_sell_or_buy transfers e ERC20 tokens
from Alice to Bob
end note
end

group case 2 : Bob denies in time and buys

holder_Bob -> blockchain : allow clause_sell_or_buy to debit x ERC20 tokens
holder_Bob -> blockchain : allow ERC1400 to debit n ERC20 tokens
holder_Bob -> blockchain : refuse Alice's bid
activate blockchain
blockchain -> blockchain : clause_sell_or_buy transfers \nall Alice's partitions to Bob 
deactivate blockchain
note left
clause_sell_or_buy transfers e ERC20 tokens
from Bob to Alice
end note
end

group case 3 : Notice runs out of time or there is litigation

controller -> blockchain : forces one of the holders to sell all one's partitions and the other one to buy
activate blockchain
blockchain -> blockchain : transfers the partitions \nand ERC20 tokens \nas ordered by the controller 
deactivate blockchain
note left
For this possibility to be available
clause_sell_or_buy must have been deployed as controlable
The controller must be registered as such
on smart contract ERC1400
end note
end
