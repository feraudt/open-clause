== Deployment of the smart contracts ==

group from developper
developer -> developer : unlock account
activate developer
developer -> blockchain : deploy smart contract ERC20 "token payment"
developer -> blockchain : deploy smart contract ERC1400 "token partitions"
note right
dependencies : ERC20
Can be controlable or not
end note
developer -> blockchain : deploy smart contract clause_X
note right
dependencies : ERC20, ERC1400
end note
deactivate developer
end

== Register the roles on smart contract ERC1400 ==

group registration holders

holders -> holders : unlock accounts
holders -> blockchain : register actors as ERC1400 holders
end

developer -> blockchain : register clause_X as ERC1400 escrow

== Acquisition of partitions ==

developer --> blockchain : transfer ERC20 tokens to the holders (who supposedly bought them)


loop for each holder \nfor as many partitions as they want

holders -> blockchain : allow ERC1400 to debit n ERC20 tokens
activate blockchain
note right
Checks solvability
end note
holders -> blockchain : buy a partition P for n tokens
note right
ERC1400 charges holder n ERC20 tokens
creation of ERC1400 partition P
end note
deactivate blockchain
end
