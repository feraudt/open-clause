actor developer
actor holder_Alice
actor holder_Bob
collections blockchain

== Deployment of the smart contracts ==

group from developper
developer -> developer : unlock account
activate developer
developer -> blockchain : deploy smart contract ERC20 "token payment"
developer -> blockchain : deploy smart contract ERC1400 "token partitions"
note right
dependencies : ERC20
Can be controlable or not
end note
developer -> blockchain : deploy smart contract clause_X
note right
dependencies : ERC20, ERC1400
end note
deactivate developer
end

== Register the roles on smart contract ERC1400 ==

group registration Alice

holder_Alice -> holder_Alice : unlock account
holder_Alice -> blockchain : register Alice as ERC1400 holder
end

group registration Bob

holder_Bob -> holder_Bob : unlock account
holder_Bob -> blockchain : register Bob as ERC1400 holder
end

developer -> blockchain : register clause_X as ERC1400 escrow

== Acquisition of partitions ==

developer --> blockchain : transfer ERC20 tokens to the holders (who supposedly bought them)

group set up the partitions

loop for as many partitions as Alice wants

holder_Alice -> blockchain : allow ERC1400 to debit n ERC20 tokens
activate blockchain
note right
Checks Alice solvability
end note
holder_Alice -> blockchain : buy a partition P for n tokens
note right
ERC1400 charges Alice n ERC20 tokens
creation of ERC1400 partition P
end note
deactivate blockchain
end

loop for as many partitions as Bob wants

holder_Bob -> blockchain : allow ERC1400 to debit n ERC20 tokens
activate blockchain
note right
Checks Bob solvability
end note
holder_Bob -> blockchain : buy a partition P for n tokens
note right
ERC1400 charges Bob n ERC20 tokens
creation of ERC1400 partition P
end note
deactivate blockchain
end
end
