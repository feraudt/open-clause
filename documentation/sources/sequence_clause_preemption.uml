...See **Sequence diagram - Deployment** above...

== Clause Preemption ==

group Preemption set up : owner Alice, buyers Bob & Charles, partition P \nvalue n, preemption price x, notice duration d, preemption duration D

holder_Alice -> blockchain : allow clause_preemption to confine partition P

holder_Alice -> blockchain : start preemption for Bob & Charles
activate blockchain
blockchain -> blockchain : start preemption timer
note left
Bob & Charles are added as potential recipients
for the incoming sales from Alice
within a duration D
end note
deactivate blockchain
holder_Alice -> blockchain : Alice sends sale notice to Bob & Charles
note right
clause_preemption checks preemption timer
end note
blockchain -> blockchain : start notice timer \nfreeze P
note left
clause_preemption confines P for a duration d
P is still Alice's property 
end note
end

group Responses \nBob accepts & Charles refuses

holder_Bob -> blockchain : allow clause_preemption to debit x ERC20 tokens 
holder_Bob -> blockchain : allow ERC1400 to debit n ERC20 tokens 
holder_Bob -> blockchain : decide to buy
note right
clause_preemption checks notice timer
end note
holder_Charles -> blockchain : decide not to buy
end

group Sale \nAlice's only choice is to sell to Bob

holder_Alice -> blockchain : initiate transfer of P to Bob
activate blockchain
blockchain -> blockchain : clause_preemption transfers x ERC20 tokens \nfrom Bob to Alice
blockchain -> blockchain : clause_preemption transfers P \nfrom Alice to Bob
deactivate blockchain
note left
ERC1400 transfers n ERC20 tokens from Bob to Alice
unfreeze P
end note
end
